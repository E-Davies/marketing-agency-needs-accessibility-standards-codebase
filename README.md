# Marketing agency needs a website that meets accessibility standards

## Description

This marketing agency's website was updated in line with the clients request for the website to follow accessibility standards and for it to be optimised for search engines.

This was achieved by:
* Adding alt text to images and icons throughout the website
* Ensuring semantic HTML elements were used and that the code followed a logical structure
* Providing a better title for the website 

Additionally:
* Bugs were fixed such as a broken navigation link
* CSS code was consolidated
